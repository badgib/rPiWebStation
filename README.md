# rPiWebStation

## OLD PROJECT

it's still in use, though

i had some raspberry pi's laying around and thought it might be a fun project  to make a little weather station for it. i also had a 7 inch lcd display... so to have music playing and not having to have my pc constantly on i decided to make this little thing.
it plays selected station from somafm.com, can change volume and also displays some weather data alongside the storm map.
it has been running now for a couple years and is still going strong
